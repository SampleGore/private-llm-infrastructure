# Local Assistant Usage & Governance Policy

Purpose  
Provide a privacy-preserving cyber assistant for learning, portfolio building, and authorized lab workflows.

Data Governance  
- Local only. No outbound sharing unless explicitly exported.
- Only user-selected documents are indexed for RAG.
- Track evidence sources when summarizing or citing.

Allowed Use  
- Policy drafting, study support, SOC triage simulations.
- Red-team topics only in explicitly authorized lab environments.
- All real-world actions must comply with law and ethics.

Assurance  
- Add a “Risk Box” for high-impact actions.
- Prefer CIS/NIST/ISO-aligned guidance.
- Preserve important chats as lab artifacts.

Auditability  
- Version or timestamp referenced documents.
- Summaries not a replacement for original evidence.

Escalation  
Escalate to human review when:
- Uncertainty affects safety or compliance.
- Considerable production risk exists.
